## Authentication & Authorization

Users are authenticated using token authentication. After providing proper username and password credentials, passwords are hashed with a user-unique salt and compared to hashed passwords stored on the MariaDB database. Tokens are generated using JWT standards and given 15 minute expirations. When a user logs out or another user decides to log in, the token is removed from the browser and (if applicable) replaced. If at any point a userâ€™s token fails authentication, it is deleted immediately and the user will be required to login again.

Many API functions requiring authorization will verify the validity of this token and restrict the user access. Users can only access limited information about other users using API routes that include userId parameters, while routes with more information will rely on correct tokens information to continue. These tokens are also secure and HTTPonly, which restricts the ability of hackers to access them with cross-site scripting attacks.


## PWA Capabilities

| Page                   | PWA Capabilities                       |      
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Home (Weekly/Calendar) | Create, edit, delete, & complete tasks | 
| Profile                | Cacheable                              |
| Household              | Cacheable                              |
| Login/Register         | Online only                            |
| Settings               | Online only                            |

While offline, users have the ability to access pages previously visited through the use of a service worker and caching. An IndexedDB database also exists on the front end to allow the user to perform basic task operations such as creating, editing, deleting, and completing a task. To avoid potential merge conflicts with different devices (or for shared tasks, different users), this implementation limits the user to these operations on tasks created while offline. Once online, current and completed tasks created offline sync with the server and are removed from the IndexedDB database. The npm idb library is used to simplify some of the IndexedDB logic to a promise-based syntax, similar to many APIs discussed in this course. Users also have the ability to install the application onto their devices.
